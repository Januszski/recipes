    </p>
    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> 2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li> Dash pepper</li>
        <li> 1 carton soft farmer cheese</li>
        <li>1 to 4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li> Sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Directions
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a large bowl, whisk eggs, water and salt until blended; 
        gradually stir in flour. Transfer to a lightly floured surface; 
        knead 10-12 times, forming a firm dough. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>  For filling, in a small bowl, whisk egg, salt, sugar and pepper. 
        Stir in cheese.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Divide dough into 4 portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion to 1/8-in.
        thickness; cut with a floured 4-in. round cookie cutter. 
        Place 1 tablespoon filling in center of each circle. 
        Moisten edges with water; fold in half and press edges to seal. 
        Repeat with remaining dough and filling. </li>
        <br>
        <li> In a 6-qt. stockpot, bring water to a boil. Add pierogi in batches; 
        reduce heat to a gentle simmer. 
        Cook until pierogi float to the top and are tender, 2-3 minutes. 
        Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
        <br>
        <li> In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high
        heat. Add pierogi in batches; cook until golden brown, 
        1-3 minutes on each side, adding additional butter as
        necessary. If desired, serve with sour cream and chives. </li>

    </ol>
